# PackMenModule7
PackMen exercise from Module 7

# Project Description: 
This project offers two features: 
- Add Packman button 
  - this button will add packman to the page.
  - with every click the button will create additional packmen. 
- Start Game 
  - This button will move the packmen with different velocity in the page. 
  - When the packmen hit the border of the page, they bounce back and stay within the view page 

# How to run the project:
1. Download the files, 
2. Open the index.html in a browser window to execute this project. 
3. There are two buttons and the information about this is provided in project description above. Use the buttons to execute the code. 

# Future Improvements:
- The 'Start Game' button - currently if pressed multiple times when game is already in motion, increases the velocity of the packmen 
  and they move faster than before. 
- This can be enhanced further. 
- Couple of ideas: 
  - Have a stop button - this would provide an option to stop the game. 
  - When 'Start Game' is clicked - if the game is already in progress, do not initiate the game again. Add the logic to implement this functionality.
  - Disable the 'Start Game' button once game is in progress, so that the process is visible to the user that button is disabled due to game in progress .
